# UDP_Server_Client
Implementation of UDP Server and Client in C++

## Steps to get it up running
1. Open **cmd** and browse to **UDP_Server/Debug** and run **UDP_Server.exe** (Server will wait to receive data).
2. Open **cmd** and browse to **UDP_Client/Debug** and run **UDP_Client.exe** (Client will send data).

## Observation
On the server you will see **DLR IS GREAT** is received 5 times. (See image : Server_Output.PNG)

*You can view the log of data on **Wireshark** on IP address **127.0.0.1**.* (See image : Wireshark_Output.PNG)
